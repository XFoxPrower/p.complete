# p.complete
p.complete is a BetterDiscord plugin that gives you IRC-style auto-completion on nicknames.

## Features
* Allows you to tag an *online* user without the need of `@` by using `Tab`.
* You can cycle through partial matches with `Tab`.
 
## How to use
1. Load up your *channel* of choice.
2. Type a full or partial match of a user's nickname.
3. Press `Tab`. Your search term will be replaced with the first matching user, complete with `@`.
4. Press `Tab` again if desired to cycle through remaining matches.

## Installation
* Copy to `C:\Users\%USERNAME%\AppData\Roaming\BetterDiscord\plugins` or wherever appropriate for your OS.
* Restart Discord if needed (`Ctrl+R`).
* Enable it in BetterDiscord's preferences
